    */
    //See line 4, the body tag

    /* 
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): How could you test the effect of you font choices you made in the body element? What could you do to see the page in Geneva or Tahoma or sans-serif?

    To test the fonts, remove the last letter in Verdana to make it Verdan, a non existent font. Geneva should then be used as the font. Once this is proven, remove the last letter in Geneva to make Gevev, another non existing font that will have browser use Tahoma. Repeat for Tahoma to see san-serif as the display. Fix the font names one at a time starting with Tahoma and working backwards to ensure that it's working as intended
